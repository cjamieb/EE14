Campbell Braun - EE14 Lab 5: More blinky blink!

1. Before the lab, I did not understand duty or why it was relevant. After completing this lab and seeing it in action, I understand its significance.
2. I am still a little unsure of how to fade the LED in and out. I know it pertains to altering the duty, but I am unsure of how to do this with complete accuracy.
3. It took me six hours to complete this lab.
